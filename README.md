# gpsrun
 
This code is supposed to show the current and previous positions of a runner on a map. The data is send live from a tracking device carried by the runner as HTTP request. This code then stores and displays the data.


As the people I am doing this for are all speaking German most of the User interface will be in German. If there is interest I might offer an English translation.
